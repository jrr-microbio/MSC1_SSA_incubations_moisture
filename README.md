## Supplementary code for manuscript titled: Environmental matrix and hydrology are key determinants of microbial community composition and expression in a reduced complexity soil-analog 

The supplementary tables that area added here contain multiple sheets that are the direct inputs to the R markdown code "Ω_Supplemental_code_upload.Rmd". Within the Rmd there are specific isntances of which sheet from which table to use as input. The rest should be (for the most part) automated to generate all figures and statistics that were used in the manuscript.

## Abstract: 
Soil moisture and porosity are key regulators of microbial metabolism due to their effects on redox conditions and substrate availability influenced by properties like gas diffusion and soil connectivity. Nonetheless, the biological, chemical, and physical heterogeneity of soil hinders our investigation of microbial metabolism because of experimental difficulties in accurately recreating the complexity of the soil environment and in establishing a tractable microbial community that minimizes confounding effects. Here, we examined long-read and short-read metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, metaproteomes, and metabolomes from a reduced-complexity microbial consortium grown in a chitin-enriched glass-bead jar system to investigate how soil environmental matrix and moisture influence chitin degradation. Highlighting the importance of the environmental matrix, our soil structure analog (SSA) system greatly altered microbial expression profiles compared to the liquid-only incubations. These differences were mainly driven by differences in the overall expression of chitin-degrading Streptomyces species and stress-tolerant Ensifer. We hypothesize that the success of Ensifer is likely related to its ability to repurpose carbon via the glyoxylate shunt, while potentially using polyhydroxyalkanoate granules as a C source.  We also identified traits that reveal mechanistic interactions that underlie the degradation of chitin in the SSA and alter carbon use efficiency like motility, stress resistance, and biofilm formation.
